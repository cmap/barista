# **Barista.js**
### Connectivity Map javascript components
------
Barista provides a library of components for working with data provided by the Connectivity Map group at the Broad Institute.  These components are centered around the core structures of Models, Collections, and Views set up in [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/ "Backbone").  The models provide sensible data objects for commonly used data types within Connectivity Map data.  The Collections group those models into common sets of data types.  The Views handle the on-screen display on either Models or Collections.  These components do not depend on each other and are meant to be the building blocks of larger applications that consume Connectivity Map data. 

## **Instalation**
